This repository contains scripts for creating vagrant boxes and openstack images for performing builds and tests of [Julia](http://julialang.org).

Large files such as the actual boxes, source `.iso` files, etc... are not included for both technical and legal reasons.  For free distributions such as Ubuntu and CentOS, `.iso` files will be downloaded automatically.  For nonfree distributions such as Mac OSX, you must place the appropriate installed images in `images/` to be processed into proper formats for virtualized consumption.
